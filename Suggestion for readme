Hi Sokravtsov,

I am a Udacity student as well.  I was looking over your OnTheMap readme file and realized that your login view has a small error.  Or at least the image you have on github does.  The link "Don't have an account? Sign Up" actually says "Sing Up".  Easy fix, thought I should let you know.

Cheers,
Bryan
